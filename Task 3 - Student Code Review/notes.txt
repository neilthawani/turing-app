Question: What can we learn about education across the state?

Three layers: 
Data access - query/search the underlying data
Relationships - create connections between related data
Analysis - relates data/relationships to draw conclusions

Goals:
Write tests to drive design/implementation of code
Decompose the app into components: parsers, repos, analysis tools
Use test fixtures instead of data when testing
Connect related objects together through references
Learn an agile approach to building software

Key Concepts:
Data about various Colorado school districts
"District" concept unifies information across the various data files
    identified by simple names (strings), listed under "Location" column of each file
Overarching data themes
    Enrollment - rates across various grade levels in each district
    Statewide testing - test results broken down by grade, race, ethnicity
    Economic profile - Socioeconomic profiles of students in districts
