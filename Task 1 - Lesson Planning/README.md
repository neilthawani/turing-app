### Task 1 - Lesson Planning

Based on my experiences, I decided to create the lesson plan for Parsing CSV in Ruby. I worked with an education startup accelerator in Kansas City called the Lean Lab about a year ago and shared my story and thought process while working on that project in the introductory video to the lesson.

I made some changes to the headers on the [default lesson plan template](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/lesson_plan_template.markdown), but the basic structure remains the same.

While creating this lesson, I found the [Introduction to CSV](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/1c9e81da24236cdd5c7e632450f0f7243e52b68e/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/intro-to-csv.markdown) on the Turing GitHub repository. I believe my lesson is slightly more detailed than that, as it touches on memory management, reviewing documentation, and edge cases involved in parsing CSV data. The challenges I faced involved conveying this information to an audience that essentially knows nothing about data processing while keeping it relevant and informative, but I tried my best.
