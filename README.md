## Task 1 - Lesson Planning
I decided to create the lesson plan for Parsing CSV in Ruby. I worked with an education startup accelerator in Kansas City called the Lean Lab about a year ago and shared my story and thought process while working on that project in the introductory video to the lesson. In the introductory video, I'm reading from a script I wrote for the recording.

While creating this lesson, I found the Introduction to CSV on the Turing GitHub repository. I believe my lesson is slightly more detailed than that, as it touches on memory management, reviewing documentation, and edge cases involved in parsing CSV data.

The challenges I faced involved conveying this information to an audience that essentially knows nothing about data processing while keeping it relevant and informative, but I tried my best.

## Task 2 - Curriculum Improvement

I am currently an Ember.js and D3.js developer at Infegy, a social media research SaaS firm in Kansas City, MO. I've grown to love Ember.js and its conventions since they're so reminiscent of Ruby. Because of this, I decided to improve the Ember Fundamentals lecture and ported the code from the good-tipper application into my own repository and fixed it up so it's fully functional.

## Task 3 - Student Code Review

After looking through the Headcount project specification and forking the [repository from a student's submission](https://github.com/jmejia/headcount), I refactored a good deal of the code, issued a pull request to my forked repository's master branch and appended in-line comments to many of the changes I made to the original source. These comments addressed basic refactoring principles, variable/method names, DRY, single responsibility, data structures, public/private variables, and setup/teardown methods for our test harnesses.
