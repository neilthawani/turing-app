## Task 1 - Lesson Planning
I decided to create the lesson plan for Parsing CSV in Ruby. In the introductory video to the lesson, I talk about my experiences working with the Lean Lab, an education startup accelerator in Kansas City. I shared my story and thought process while working on that project while I read from a script I wrote for the recording.

While creating this lesson, I found Turing's [Introduction to CSV](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/intro-to-csv.markdown) lesson. I believe my lesson is slightly more detailed than that, as it touches on memory management, reviewing documentation, and edge cases involved in parsing CSV data.

The challenges I faced involved conveying this information to an audience that essentially knows nothing about data processing while keeping it relevant and informative.

## Task 2 - Curriculum Improvement

I am currently an Ember.js and D3.js developer at Infegy, a social media research SaaS firm in Kansas City, MO. I've grown to love Ember.js and its conventions since they're so reminiscent of Ruby on Rails. Because of this, I decided to improve the Ember Fundamentals lecture. I also reviewed the code from the [good-tipper](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/good-tipper) application and created a new, working, and up-to-date Ember CLI app called great-tipper.

## Task 3 - Student Code Review

After looking through the Headcount project specification and forking the [repository from a student's submission](https://github.com/jmejia/headcount), I refactored a good deal of the code, issued a pull request to my forked repository's master branch and appended in-line comments to many of the changes I made to the original source. These comments addressed basic refactoring principles, variable/method names, DRY, single responsibility, data structures, public/private variables, and setup/teardown methods for our test harnesses.
