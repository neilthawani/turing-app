### Task 3

After looking through the Headcount project specification and forking the [repository from a student's submission](https://github.com/jmejia/headcount), I forked the repository and refactored a good deal of the code. I issued a pull request to my forked repository's master branch and appended in-line comments to many of the changes I made to the original source. These comments addressed basic refactoring principles, variable/method names, DRY, single responsibility, data structures, public/private variables, and setup/teardown methods for our test harnesses. You can view that pull request [here](https://github.com/neilthawani/headcount/pull/1).
